Description: Privacy-focused cryptocurrency with CPU mining
 Juno Cash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency with CPU mining (RandomX)
 and a 21M coin supply. Forked from Zcash v6.10.0, it features mandatory
 Orchard shielded transactions, 60-second blocks, and 100% mining rewards
 with no developer tax.
 This package provides the daemon, junocashd, and a CLI tool, junocash-cli,
 to interact with the daemon.
